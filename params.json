Add a VHOST\r\n\r\n2. Start learning mode on this VHOST\r\n\r\n3. Make every legit user inputs possible on the site (modifying hosts file, we recommend to publish DNS entry after the whole process)\r\n\r\n4. Stop learning mode on the VHOST\r\n\r\n5. Understand the rules\r\n\r\n6. You're done!\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nMyWaf usage:\r\n------------\r\n\r\nmywaf [add VHOST IP | del VHOST]       Add/delete selected VHOST\r\nmywaf list                             List enabled VHOST\r\nmywaf [learn VHOST | stoplearn VHOST]  Enable/disable learning mode on VHOST\r\nmywaf understand VHOST                 Process whitelist from logs (CARE if you've \r\n      \t\t \t\t       ALREADY been ATTACKED!)\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
